# Requirements

# Fixed File Format converter

The goal is to write a generic tool to convert fixed file format files to a csv file based on a metadata file describing its structure.

Languages chosen: Python 3.7.0 

Approach: 
1. Read the data descriptor file 
2. Write the header row in the output csv
3. Read the flat file and write each line being read to the output file 

# Dependencies
* Python 3.7.0

# Instructions to use
* Clone repo 
* In your terminal run the following command

    ```python <FFFC_LOCATION>/file_converter.py <METADATA_CSV_FILE> <FLAT_FILE> <OUTPUT_CSV_FILE>```

    e.g. `~/workspaces/fffc $ python /home/vighy-vbox/workspaces/fffc/file_converter.py data/metadata.csv data/large_data_file data/large_data_file.csv`


## TODO
* Add more test cases
* Implement async io to speed up the process


## Use case

Our fixed file format files can have any number of columns
A column can be of 3 formats:
* date (format yyyy-mm-dd)
* numeric (decimal separator '.' ; no thousands separator ; can be negative)
* string

The structure of the file is described in a metadata file in csv format with a line for each column defining:
* column name
* column length
* column type

You should transform the file to a csv file (separator ',' and row separator CRLF)

The dates have to be reformatted to dd/mm/yyyy

The trailing spaces of string columns must be trimmed

The csv file must include a first line with the columns names

## Example

Data file:
```
1970-01-01John           Smith           81.5
1975-01-31Jane           Doe             61.1
1988-11-28Bob            Big            102.4
```

Metadata file:
```
Birth date,10,date
First name,15,string
Last name,15,string
Weight,5,numeric
```

Output file:
```
Birth date,First name,Last name,Weight
01/01/1970,John,Smith,81.5
31/01/1975,Jane,Doe,61.1
28/11/1988,Bob,Big,102.4
```

## Extra requirements
* files are encoded in UTF-8 and may contain special characters
* strings columns may contain separator characters like ',' and then the whole string needs to be escaped with " (double quotes). Only CR or LF are forbidden
* in case the format of the file is not correct, the program should fail but say explicitly why
* a fixed format file may be very big (several GB)
