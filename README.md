# Fixed File Format Converter

The folder is composed of several files :
* file_converter.py, which contains the logic of the conversion task
* command_line_parser.py, a module that recovers the arguments from command line
* README.md
* requirements.txt, that specifies the dependencies and help create a similar execution environment
* unit_test.py, which unique purpose is to be called during unit testing 
* test_data, a folder containing data used in the test phase
* generate_large_file.py, that generates raw input files of a given size - used to test the program with 'large' input files

## Command Line Interface
The CLI takes 3 arguments
* --input_path or -i (string, default 'input.txt'): path towards the input "raw" file
* --meta_path or -m (string, default 'meta.txt'): path towards the metadata file
* --output_path or -o (string, default 'output.csv'): path towards the output csv file after conversion (created if not found)

Accordingly, a valid call could be ```python file_converter.py -i path/to/input.txt --output path/to/output.csv -m path/to/meta.txt```, or the simple ```python file_converter.py``` if the 3 files are named after the default and located at the root.

## Execution Environnement
This project uses Python 3.7.3 (and does not use any external package). If you encounter a problem running it, then installing the dependencies with ```pip install -r requirements.txt ``` should solve it.

## Implementation Choices
Several checks are made on the input and metadata files, and raise an exception if they fail.

The only check performed on the metadata file is that the number of fields per line should be exactly 3 (name, size and type). 

Several checks are made on the input raw file :
* The length of each line should be the same, which is actually the sum of the length the fields.
* Spaces are not allowed 'inside' the field, in such a way that '  bob ' is valid but ' b ob ' is not.
* Dates should be in the correct specified format yyyy-mm-dd.

## Tests
To run the tests, just run ```pytest``` at the root, and it will call unit_test.py, containing 10 tests.

## Large files
The program can run on files too big to hold in RAM. To do so, files are never loaded entirely, but read line by line. I performed a conversion of a 2.0 Go file on my machine with success, in 18 minutes.

## Improvements
I am more than open to comments and suggestions about code quality, efficiency or bugs! Features that could be improved include :
* A better exception management system, provinding more precise information and provide better testing abilities
* A wider range of test use cases
* A more robust deployment
